# InvokerGame
[THIS CODE IS OLD AND BAD, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT]
Learning unity by making an old project come to life.
The game is a rip off from color sheep but using the invoker mechanics(a hero from DoTA2).
It plays out with 2 types of enemies, a fying one (which does not move and only throws spells at the player) and a walking one.
The flying enemy can not be killed, the only thing you can (have to do) is to avoid his attacks using the invoker combinations by pressing the defense button. For the walking enemy, they come out of a enemy spawner (random rates of spawn, properties and speed), unlike the flying enemy you can(have to) kill them, by using the invoker combinations but this time using the attack button.
Score does not work, same as lvl1, lvl2 and boss fight. Maybe i'll finish this some day, probably not.
